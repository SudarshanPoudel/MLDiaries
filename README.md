# ML Diaries

Welcome to **ML Diaries**, a comprehensive resource documenting my journey in learning AI and Machine Learning. This project provides detailed notes, explanations, figures, and code snippets to help you learn and revise various ML concepts effectively.

## Getting Started

To explore the content, visit the [ML Diaries website](https://sudarshanpoudel.github.io/MLDiaries/index.html).

## Project Overview

ML Diaries is organized into three main content types:

1. **Modules:** Documenting the journey through various AI/ML concepts. Each module includes explanations, figures, code snippets, and links to external resources for further study. Currently, only one module (Regression and Classification) is completed, but 12-13 more modules are planned.

2. **Projects:** Detailed documentation of ML projects with code. These projects are styled like Jupyter notebooks but converted to HTML for better presentation. They include step-by-step explanations and visualizations.

3. **Paper Reviews:** Reviews or simpler explanations of research papers. These reviews aim to make complex research more accessible and easier to understand.
